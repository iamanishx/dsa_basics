## Singly Linked List Algorithms

Below are the key singly linked list topics covered in this repository. Click the links to view code and explanations:

- [Basic Operations](linked-list/singly-ll/baiscll.cpp): Insert, delete, search, traverse, and length of singly linked list.
- [Reverse Linked List](linked-list/singly-ll/reverse_sll.cpp): Iterative and recursive reversal algorithms.
- [Find Middle Node](linked-list/singly-ll/middle_sll.cpp): Find the middle node using slow/fast pointer technique.
- [Detect Loop](linked-list/singly-ll/detect_loop_sll.cpp): Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare).
- [Remove Duplicates](linked-list/singly-ll/remove_duplicates_sll.cpp): Remove duplicates from a sorted linked list.
- [Merge Sorted Lists](linked-list/singly-ll/merge_sorted_sll.cpp): Merge two sorted singly linked lists.
- [Nth Node from End](linked-list/singly-ll/nth_from_end_sll.cpp): Find the nth node from the end using two pointers.
- [Palindrome Linked List](linked-list/singly-ll/palindrome_sll.cpp): Check if the linked list is a palindrome.

Each file contains code, algorithm description, and related LeetCode problems for further practice.
